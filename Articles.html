       <p>If you ask most people what is their one major objective in life, they would probably give you a vague
        answer, such as "I want to be a successful, be happy, make a good living" and that is it.
        They are all wishes and none of them are clear goals.
        A smart goal must be taken with serious consideration and planning, not just anything or anyone 
        you wish or love to be,but who you really have to be, In doing this, you must input great effort
        and determination to make it a dream come true.
