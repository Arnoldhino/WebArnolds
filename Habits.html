<li><strong>Practice voice exercises</strong><br>
Why?  Because i w ant to speak openly and confidently with my natual voice.
And also, it just makes me feel a lot more better anytime i practice, i think it's a very 
nice  habit.
  
<p>
  <li><strong>Body and Posture Awareness</strong><br>
   Why? Because it helps me to relax my muscles and nerves ,it also makes me release a lot    of tension.
  I think this habit is good because it helps reduce the rate at which one gets tired easily
  and it prevents a couple of diseases associated with incorrect body postures.

  <p>
    <li><strong>Drink Enough Water</strong><br>
    Because our bodies are made up of 60% water. so satying hydrated is one of the easiest
    ways to stay healthy .keep hydrated and stay healthy. keep hydrated and you'll notice
    a lot of changes in your sysytem.(Digestion, Skin beauty, sparkling eyes, Energy and
    a very very strong immune system.)
  
    <p>
      <li><strong>Be Sure To eat Well</strong><br>
      Ah eating healthy finally, healthy people do this everyday amd i think even unhealthy
      people as wwell, because eating is a habit that everyone has or must practice.
      But this habit can also be a hard one to fall into.
      Many of us stuggle to make the right food choices of food we suppose to eat.
      but rather we eat based on our appetite amd temptation of the food's garnish.
      we must make good eating habit a priority in our lifes.

      <p>
        <li><strong>prioritise Your Sleep Quality</strong><br>
        Never underestimate the power of sleep. The recommended 6-9 hours of sleep per night
        allows our bodies and brains to repair and recover. As well as boosting immunity,
         a good night's sleep helps you maintain a healthy weight, increases fertility and boosts 
         your mental wellbeing.
         However, lack of the needed sleep hours can lead toincreased risk of dibetes, cancer, obesity
         and depression.

         <p>
          <li><strong>Make Time to Do The Things You Love</strong><br>                   
       this is no small habit to practice. But research tells us not to overlook the power of 
       finding the ,meaning and purpose of in our Life- doing the things that makes us feel worhty.
       Not only does it make you happy but it may help to lower your risk of health problems like 
       stroke and depression.
